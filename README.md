The Real Estate Price Prediction Model is an advanced machine learning project designed to estimate property prices accurately using historical data. This model was developed using data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, a well-known source for high-quality datasets. Leveraging the Random Forest Regressor algorithm, the model achieves robust and reliable predictions by combining the output of multiple decision trees to minimize errors and enhance performance.
